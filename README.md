## Key Features

- **Flexible Dependency Management:** Includes an example `pyproject.toml` file. While the template recommends using tools like `uv` for dependency management, users are free to choose alternatives such as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), or any other tool that supports the `pyproject.toml` format.
- **Code Quality Assurance:** Integrated with `ruff` for static code analysis and formatting.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Configured via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to enforce code standards before commits.
- **Standardized Structure:** Provides essential documentation files, including the Code of Conduct, Contribution Guidelines, and Security Policy.

## Environment and Dependency Management

- **Python Version:** Please refer to the `.python-version` file for the specified Python version.
- **Dependency Management Options:**  
  - The project includes a `pyproject.toml` file for managing dependencies and project configuration.
  - **Recommended Option:** You may use the `uv` tool for creating virtual environments, synchronizing dependencies, and running project commands.  
  - **Alternative Options:** Alternatively, you are free to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), or any other tool that supports `pyproject.toml`.

- **Essential Tools:**
  1. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh) – A "recommended" option for virtual environment and dependency management.
  2. [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) – For managing Git pre-commit hooks.
  3. [ruff](https://ruff.dev) – For code style and formatting checks.

> **Note:** The dependencies provided (except for `ruff`) are for demonstration purposes. Please adjust or replace them based on your project requirements.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install the Required Tools**
   - Refer to the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh) and [pre-commit website](https://pre-commit.com) for installation instructions.
   - Alternatively, if you prefer another tool (such as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)), ensure it is installed and configured accordingly.

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**
   - **Using uv (recommended):**
     ```bash
     uv venv create
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Alternative:** If using another tool (e.g., Poetry), create and activate the virtual environment as per that tool’s instructions.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - **Using uv (recommended):**
     ```bash
     uv sync
     ```
   - **Alternative:** Use your chosen dependency management tool to install dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

4. **Run the Project**
   - Execute the sample main program:
     ```bash
     uv run main.py
     ```
     or use your preferred method if not using `uv`.

5. **Perform Code Quality Checks**
   - Run static code analysis and formatting checks using `ruff`:
     ```bash
     uv run ruff
     ```
     or run `ruff` directly if you are not using `uv` commands.

## Integrated Tools

This project integrates the following tools to enhance development efficiency and maintain high coding standards:

- **uv:** Recommended for managing virtual environments and executing project-specific commands.
- **pre-commit:** Automatically checks code quality before commits to prevent non-compliant submissions.
- **ruff:** A fast and lightweight static code analysis tool that ensures adherence to coding standards.

For additional configuration details, please refer to the official documentation of each tool.
